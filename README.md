TSF Task 3:Payment gateway Integration

Hi,I made this website as a web development and design intern at the sparks foundation. The task was to create a simple website where payment gateway is integrated.It is a covid relief donation website, I've used razorpay API(in test mode) to accept the  donations.

I got to learn a lot during this past month,it was an amazing experience interning at The sparks foundation.
